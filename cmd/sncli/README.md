# sncli - Supernode CLI Client

`sncli` is a lightweight command-line interface for interacting with a Lumera Supernode over secure gRPC. It supports health checks, service discovery, task registration, and status queries.

---

## üîß Build Instructions

To build `sncli` from source:

```bash
make build-sncli
```

> The binary will be located at: `release/sncli`

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a `config.toml` file in the same directory where you run `sncli`:

```toml
# Lumera blockchain connection settings
[lumera]
grpc_addr = "localhost:9090"
chain_id = "lumera-devnet-1"

# Keyring settings for managing keys and identities
[keyring]
backend = "test"                     # "file", "test", or "os"
dir = "~/.lumera"                    # Directory where keyring is stored
key_name = "sncli-account"           # Name of local key
local_address = "lumera1abc..."      # Bech32 address of local account (must exist on-chain)

# Supernode peer information
[supernode]
grpc_endpoint = "127.0.0.1:4444"
address = "lumera1supernodeabc123"   # Bech32 address of the Supernode
```

> Ensure the `local_address` exists on-chain (i.e., has received funds or sent a tx).

---

## üöÄ Usage

Run the CLI by calling the built binary with a command:

```bash
./sncli [<options>] <command> [args...]
```

### Supported Command-Line Options

| Option          | Description                                                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --config        | Path to config file. Supports ~. Default: ./config.toml or SNCLI_CONFIG_PATH environment variable |
| --grpc_endpoint | Override gRPC endpoint for Supernode (e.g., 127.0.0.1:4444)                                       |
| --address       | Override Supernode's Lumera address                                                               |

| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `help`               | Show usage instructions                                  |
| `list`               | List available gRPC services from the Supernode          |
| `list` `<service>` | List methods in a specific gRPC service                  |
| `health-check`       | Check if the Supernode is alive                          |
| `get-status`         | Query current CPU/memory usage reported by the Supernode |

### Example

```bash
./sncli --config ~/.sncli.toml --grpc_endpoint 10.0.0.1:4444 --address lumera1xyzabc get-status
```

## üìù Notes

- `sncli` uses a secure gRPC connection with a handshake based on the Lumera keyring.
- The Supernode address must match a known peer on the network.
- Make sure`sncli-account` has been initialized and exists on the chain.
- Config file path is resolved using this algorithm:
  - First uses --config flag (if provided)
  - Else uses SNCLI_CONFIG_PATH environment variable (if defined)
  - Else defaults to ./config.toml
